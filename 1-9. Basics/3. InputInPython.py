# type() gives data type of whatever we pass into it

# eg. type( name ) will give data type of name variable

# eg. type(x) will give data type of x variable

# eg. type(5) will give data type of 5 which is int (i.e integer)

# eg. type("Hello") will give data type of 5 which is string 

# eg. type(5.95) will give data type of 5.95 which is float ( ie floating point number ie decimal number)







# input in python is taken using   input()


# by default, input() takes string input

# below line will take STRING input from user and store it inside of a variable called userInput # NOTE: name of a variable can be ANY WORD

userInput = input()

# below line will first detect data type of variable named userInput using type()
# and then display it using print()

print( type(userInput) )

# NOTE: whatever input is given by user, input() will by default take it as STRING INPUT
