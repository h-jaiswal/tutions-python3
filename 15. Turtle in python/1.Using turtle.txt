turtle  (small case/letters)

turtle is a pre installed library in python which allows us to draw (shapes, figures, etc) on a virtual canvas (screen).

The on-screen pen that is used to draw is called the turtle (by default, shape of pen is arrow shape, it can be changed tto look like a turtle if we write turtle.shape("turtle") )

turtle library/module needs to be included in your program file before it can be used. To include turtle in your program

we write, import turtle on top of our program file, example,

import turtle

def main():
    #
    #
main()







import turtle 
This line needs to be included 
at the beginning of your 
program to import the turtle 
library into Python, allowing 
you to use the turtle functions. 


scr = turtle.Screen() 
Defines the window as being 
called “scr”. This means we can 
use the shorthand “scr”, rather 
than having to refer to the window 
by its full name each time. 


scr.bgcolor(“yellow”) 
Sets the screen background 
colour to yellow. By default, the 
background colour will be 
white unless it is changed. 


turtle.pensize(3) 
Changes the turtle pen size 
(the thickness of the line that is 
drawn) to 3. By default, this is 1 
unless it is changed. 


turtle.penup() 
Removes the pen from 
the page so that as the 
turtle moves it does not 
leave a trail behind it. 


turtle.pendown() 
Places the pen on the 
page so that when the 
turtle moves it will 
leave a trail behind it. 
By default, the pen is 
down unless specified 
otherwise. 


turtle.forward(50) 
Moves the turtle forward 50 
steps. 


turtle.left(120) 
Turns the turtle 120° to 
the left (counter 
clockwise). 

turtle.right(90) 
Turns the turtle 90° to 
the right (clockwise). 


turtle.showturtle() 
Shows the turtle on the screen. 
By default, the turtle is 
showing unless specified 
otherwise. 


turtle.hideturtle() 
Hides the turtle so it is not 
showing on the screen. 


turtle.shape(“turtle”) 
Changes the shape of the turtle to look like a turtle 
. By default, the turtle will look like a small arrow. 


turtle.exitonclick() 
When the user clicks on the 
turtle window it will 
automatically close. 


turtle.begin_fill() 
Entered before the code that draws a shape so it 
knows to fill in the shape it is drawing. 


turtle.end_fill() 
Entered after the code that is drawing the shape to 
tell Python to stop filling in the shape.
