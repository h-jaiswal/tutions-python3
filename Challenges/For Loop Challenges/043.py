Ask which direction the user wants to count (up or down).

If they select up, then ask (if)
        them for the top number and 
        then count from 1 to that number.  (loop)

If they select down, ask (elif)
        them to enter a number below 20 and 
        then count down from 20 to that number. (loop)

If they (else)
entered something other than up or down, display the message “I don’t understand”.
