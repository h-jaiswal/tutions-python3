1.    import random

    This must appear at 
    the start of your 
    program otherwise 
    the random 
    function will not 
    work. 

2.  num = random.random()    # random is the module name, and random() is the inbuilt function name

    random.random()     Selects a random    floating-point number (decimal number)    between 0 and 1 
    and here in above example
    stores it in a variable called “num”.
