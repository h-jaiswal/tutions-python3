Relational Operators are Operators which are used to Compare Things

These are:

CATERGORY 1 

NOTE -> Only works for comparing numbers

a > b   Here > means greater than operator.

Here a > b gives True IF value of a is GREATER THAN b OTHERWISE it gives False

Similiary we have < i.e. less than operator example a < b  gives True IF value of a is LESS THAN b OTHERWISE it gives False



a >= b   Here >= means greater than or equal to operator

Here a >= b  gives  True  IF value of a is either greater than b or equal to b OTHERWISE False

Similiary we have <= i.e. less than or equal to operator example a <= b  gives True IF value of a is LESS THAN or EQUAL TO b OTHERWISE it gives False



CATERGORY 2 

NOTE: Works for boths strings and numbers
example, 
        myname = "Harshit
        yourname = "Rishav"
        myname == yourname gives False

a == b   

Here == is called "is equal to" operator

a == b 

Gives True  IF value and data type (numbers(float or int) and string etc.) of a and b are both equal OTHERWISE it gives False




a != b

Here != is called "not equal to" operator


Gives True  IF value and data type (numbers(float or int) and string etc.) of a and b are both NOT equal OTHERWISE it gives False
