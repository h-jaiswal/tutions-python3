# Relational Operator

# are operators which give result as either true or false

# example

# a > b  ie. greater than

# means, a > b IS TRUE if a is greater than b OTHERWISE it is FALSE




# a < b  ie. lesser than

# means, a < b IS TRUE if a is lesser than b OTHERWISE it is FALSE




# a >= b i.e. greater than or equal to 

# means, a >= b IS TRUE if a is greater than or equal to b OTHERWISE it is FALSE





# a <= b ie. lesser than or equal to 

# means, a <= b IS TRUE if a is lesser than or equal to b OTHERWISE it is FALSE




# a == b  i.e equals to

# means, a == b IS TRUE if a is equal to b OTHERWISE it is FALSE




# a != b  ie. not equals to

# means, a == b IS TRUE if a is not equal to b OTHERWISE it is FALSE
