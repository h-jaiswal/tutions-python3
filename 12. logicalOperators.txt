LOGICAL Operators

are used to combined two or more conditions

What is a condition ?   A condition is an expression which either gives True as final value or False as final value

example. 

10 > 12 

age >= 18

amount == 0

sum != 0


Now we can combine two or more condition using LOGICAL Operators.


These are


and Operator

condition1 and condition2

Definition of and operator : will give True if and only if both condition1 and condition2 are True

otherwise it gives False in other cases.

Possible 4 cases

True and True  will give final result as True

True and False  will give final result as False

False and True  will give final result as False

False and False  will give final result as False




or Operator

condition1 or condition2

Definition of or operator : will give True if and only if ATLEAST ONE OF condition1 and condition2 is/are True
                            otherwise it gives False in other cases.

In other words: condition1 or condition2 gives False if and only if both condition1 and condition2 are False
                otherwise it gives True in all other cases.

Possible 4 cases

True or True  will give final result as True

True or False  will give final result as True

False or True  will give final result as True

False or False  will give final result as False




not operator

not operator is a special operator which inverts a given condition 

example

not (condition)

if condition is True, the doing     not (condition)      will give False

if condition is False, the doing     not (condition)      will give True
