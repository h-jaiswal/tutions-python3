# if else in Python can be used to write Decision Making statements

# example - who will vote ?


# if else statment starts
if (condition) :
    # if starts
    # note: if part will run only when CONDITION is True
    all statements come of if part here
    # if ends
else :
    # else starts
    # note: else part will run only when CONDITION is False
    all statements of else part come here
    # else ends
# if else statement ends


NOTE : 

1. else part is optional i.e. if part can be used seperately without else part

2. vice versa is not true



def main():
    age = int(input("Enter age: "))

    if (age >= 18) :  # colon is necessary, space after 'if' is necessary
        # tab space (indentation) is required 
        print("I am allowed to get voter card and vote.")
    
    else :   # colon is necessary
        # indentation is required
        print("I am not allowed to vote or even get a voter card.")

    # main continues
