There are many ways to use for loop

1. for loop in combination with range(first) function

When to use this combination?
Use this whenever you want to repeat a set of task for a known number of times

example, to print name 5 times

name = "Rishav"
for i in range(5):
    print(name)

i is the loop variable whose value changes from 0 to 4, range comes from the range function

example code

*************
def main():

    # name = "Rishav"
    # for i in range(10):
    #     print(i)
    #     print(name)

    
    name = "Rishav"
    for i in range(10):
        print( "#" + str(i+1) + " " + name)

    v = 0
    while(v < 10):
        print(name)
        v = v + 1

main()
*************




2. for loop in combination with range function (first, second)

example

for i in range(5, 10):
    print(i)


output:
5
6
7
8
9

NOTE: LOOP repeats from (second argument - first argument) times i.e here 10-5 = 5 times
