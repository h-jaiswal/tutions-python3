turtle  (small case/letters)

turtle is a pre installed library in python which allows us to draw (shapes, figures, etc) on a virtual canvas (screen).

The on-screen pen that is used to draw is called the turtle (by default, shape of pen is arrow shape, it can be changed tto look like a turtle if we write turtle.shape("turtle") )

turtle library/module needs to be included in your program file before it can be used. To include turtle in your program

we write, import turtle on top of our program file, example,

import turtle

def main():
    #
    #
main()
